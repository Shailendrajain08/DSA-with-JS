// ==> What is Recursion ? 
// ==> Recursion is Problem solving technique where the solution depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem. 

// Recursion is when function calls it self

// ==> Why Recursion ? 
// ==> A Great technique to Simplify your solution. i
// If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller version of the same problem, recursion is very useful. 

// A Few points about Recursion 
// --------------------------------------------------------------
// 1) Every recursion solution need to have a base case -a condition to terminate the recursion
// 2) Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A Recursion solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution. 
// 3) Recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand.
